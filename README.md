# Description of the game
The aim of this project is to implement Terra Mystica, a board game, into digital platform. 
Terra Mystica is a round-based game where players choose their faction with specified abilities 
and aim to get the highest point. There are 14 factions in the game and 7 different tiles in the map.
Every tile belongs to 2 factions. Points can be earned via several ways: religion, land adjacency, 
round-based bonuses... As the rounds advance, players 
may build some structures on their land or make some developments for their hand. Meanwhile,
they earn some resources like workers or power through their buildings and advancements.
After 6 rounds, the points get summed up and winner gets chosen. 

  
# Additional Features
Some additional features that have been thought during implementing the game to digital platform.

-After each round, structures' appearances on the map will change in order to visualize the modernity of a new era.

-The incomes of different kind of structures will be displayed when a specific button is clicked.

-The imaginary factions will be replaced with historical characters while preserving their abilities.

-The ancient cults will be replaced with real religions while preserving the logic.
